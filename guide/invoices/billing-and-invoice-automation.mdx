# Billing cycle & invoice automation

The billing cycle task manager is the engine that triggers the end-of-month invoice approval flow.  
At the end of each month, invoices can be found on the billing cycle section ready for review, approval and sync with ERP.  
Once invoices are approved, they become locked for editing and ready to be exported to CSV. or sync.

  

>ðŸ’¡  **Please note**
> -   Billing cycles are generated automatically
> -   Billing starts on the 1st of each calendar month and represents the data metered for the period of the previous month.
