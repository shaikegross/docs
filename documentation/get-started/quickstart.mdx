### Get Started 

Getting started with Vayu is as simple as 1, 2, 3. <br/>
Check out the steps you’ll need to take. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Pricing Plan">
    You can create pricing plans for specific customers or subsidiaries, or create generic pricing plans to use as templates that can be customized as necessary. 
    
    Any plan can combine whichever kinds of pricing you need, whether it’s usage-based, commitment fees, tiered pricing, etc. and you can choose the currency you need for each plan as well. You also get to define the start date, duration, and how often invoices are created and at what intervals. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore Invoices">
    You’ll have real-time insight into your customers’ consumption at any given time, as well as what that means for their billing. Invoices are generated automatically and accurately according to your specifications, and when they’re ready you can review, modify if desired, and send.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Customers">
    You can add customers from data in a CSV file, sync via a Salesforce or Hubspot integration, or manually, using the quick and simple process in the Vayu platform. You can establish subsidiaries and related entities with ease as well. 

    Once a customer is set up, you can check out their current billing and usage state, balance snapshot, issued and overdue invoices, and more, at any time. 
  </Step>
    <Step title="Data Metering">
    The Vayu platform gives you visibility into your events and data metering. <br/>
    You’ll be able to view all the events that have been digested and counted by the platform, download consumption reports and define products to meter.
