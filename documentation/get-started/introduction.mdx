Modern businesses offer a wide variety of pricing options, from usage-based pricing, fixed fees, subscription costs, tiered pricing, discounts, promotions and more. Companies want to be able to give their customers the pricing that suits their needs and the products being used, and is sensitive to differences between geographies or subsidiaries.

Vayu's vision is that embracing total pricing flexibility should be fast, easy, accurate and hassle-free. With Vayu, that's just what happens.

Integrating with Vayu takes just a few hours, via simple RESTful API integration. Once that's done, Vayu's platform will be able to receive events of all kinds from your BI, CRM, and ERP platforms. Any event, from any source, can be a billable event. How it's billed is up to you, and can be established using Vayu's simple and intuitive low-code/no-code interface, with commercial terms from diverse platforms aligned and reflected in your invoices.

Setting up pricing plans, pricing plan templates, and contracts for specific customers can be done quickly and easily by finance and operational teams using the manual option within the Vayu platform. Alternatively, you can simply pull this data from your existing systems.

Once a billing plan is set up, all billing invoices are generated automatically at the relevant time. You'll also get real-time insights into customers' usage and how that translates into billing. You can change how customers are billed at any time.

### Architecture Principles
Vayu is built to empower companies with complete independence when it comes to pricing and billing.

Developer or data resources are only required for the initial integration of a few hours.
