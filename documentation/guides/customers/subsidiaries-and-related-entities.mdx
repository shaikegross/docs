It is possible to create a hierarchy between entities and associate "child" entities with a parent account. This provides a high level of customization, allowing you to either issue invoices to each entity or subsidiary separately, or aggregate the charges to the main parent account.

-  Go to **Customers** and select the customer account (parent) you wish to edit

- go to the **Settings** tab and scroll down to find the related **Entities and Branches** section

- click the **+ Add related entity** and select the customer you wish to add. You can add unlimited number of entities.

Once done, make sure to **Save**.
