It is possible to create a hierarchy between entities and associate "child" entities with a parent account. This provides a high level of customization, allowing you to either issue invoices to each entity or subsidiary separately, or aggregate the charges to the main parent account.

-  In the main menu bar, click **Customers** and select the customer account (parent) you wish to edit

- Go to the **Settings** tab and scroll down to find the related **Entities and Branches** section

- Click the **+ Add related entity** and select the customer you wish to add. You can add **unlimited number of entities**.

Once done, make sure to **Save**.
