Realtime invoicing allows for you to see at any given moment the current and accurate consumption of each customer.  

From here, you can view a summary of all invoices or a summary of each individual invoice, as well as download, export, or sync.

This view allows for commitment/credits follow-ups, decision-making on charging for overages, and engagement with the customer service and sales teams prior to invoice issuance.
