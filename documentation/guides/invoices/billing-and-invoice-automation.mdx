title: 'Monthly Closure & Invoice Automation'
---

The billing cycle task manager is the engine that triggers the end-of-month invoice approval flow.  
At the end of each month, invoices can be found in the **Monthly Closure** section ready for review, approval, and sync with ERP.  
Once invoices are approved, they become locked for editing and ready to be exported to a CSV or sync.
