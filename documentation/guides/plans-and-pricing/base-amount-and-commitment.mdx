title: 'Base Amount and Commitment'
---

#### Configuration of Base Amount 
> Base amounts allow you to set a minimum amount to be charged in cases of “0” consumption. This is only applicable for metered or usage-based products.
The base amount is set on the product line item so you must start with a product line item.

  
-   **Go to Plans**--> New plan--> add products & prices -->  
    select "Tier pricing "
    
-   Add by clicking on the **"+"** **"Base amount"**
    
-   Enter the **amount to be charged** in case of no usage metered
    
-   **Delete** or **edit** by hovering with your mouse to edit or delete functions
   
<Tip>
    **Please Note** <br/>
    Base amounts are only applicable for usage products (otherwise it's easier to go for "fixed recurring" pricing). <br/>
    Base amount charges will be added to the customer's invoice according to the plan's billing interval. <br/>
    All amounts are calculated in USD.

#### Configuration of Commitment

> Commitment is the minimum <u>quantity</u> a customer has committed to purchase <u>during the plan lifetime</u>.
The commitment is set on the product line item so you must start by creating a product.

-   **Go to Plans-->** New plan--> add products & prices --> select "Tier pricing "  
-   Add by clicking on the **"Commitment"** button  
-   Enter the number of units you want to set as your commitment
-   **Delete** or **edit** by hovering with your mouse to edit or delete functions
    
<Tip>
    **Please Note** <br/>
    Commitment can be used for usage products with tiered-based pricing. <br/>
    Commitments are counted in units and calculated based on the price per unit (the defined tier).
