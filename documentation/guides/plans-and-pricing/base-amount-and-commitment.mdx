## Base Amount Configuration

Base amounts provide a way to ensure minimum revenue from usage-based products, even when there's no actual usage. This is particularly useful for services where you want to guarantee a minimum monthly revenue while still allowing for usage-based pricing above that minimum.

### Setting Up Base Amounts

Base amounts are configured at the product line item level in your pricing plans:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Plan Creation">
    Go to **Plans & Pricing** → **New plan** → **Add pricing & products** → select **Tiered Pricing**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Base Amount">
    Click **+ Set Base Amount** to add a minimum charge
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Amount">
    Enter the **amount to be charged** that will apply when no usage is recorded
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage Settings">
    You can **Delete** or **edit** the base amount by hovering over it with your mouse
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Base Amount Best Practices**
  - Only use base amounts for usage-based products
  - For fixed recurring charges, use the "fixed recurring" pricing type instead
  - Base amounts are added to invoices based on the plan's billing interval
  - All amounts are calculated in USD
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Common Base Amount Mistakes to Avoid**
  - Don't confuse base amounts with commitments - base amounts are minimum charges, while commitments are minimum usage quantities
  - Ensure base amounts don't exceed the expected usage-based charges for typical customers
  - Remember that base amounts apply to each billing interval, not the entire contract duration
</Warning>

## Commitment Configuration

Commitments represent the minimum quantity a customer agrees to purchase during the entire plan lifetime. Unlike base amounts that focus on monetary values, commitments deal with usage quantities.

### How Commitments Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commitment Period">
    Commitments are evaluated over the entire plan duration, not per billing interval. For example, in a 12-month plan, the commitment is checked against the total usage across all 12 months.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Billing Impact">
    The system tracks usage against the commitment and bills according to the pricing tiers, ensuring the minimum committed quantity is properly charged even if actual usage falls short.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Overage Handling">
    Usage beyond the commitment level is billed according to the defined pricing tiers, treating the commitment as a minimum rather than a cap.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Setting Up Commitments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Plan Settings">
    Navigate to **Plans & Pricing** → **New plan** → **Add pricing & products** → select **Tiered Pricing**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Commitment">
    Click **+ Set Commitment** to define the minimum quantity
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Units">
    Enter the number of units you want to set as your commitment level
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage Settings">
    You can **Delete** or **edit** the commitment by hovering with your mouse
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Commitment Configuration Best Practices**
  - Use commitments with tiered-based pricing for usage products
  - Set realistic commitment levels based on customer usage patterns
  - Consider the entire contract duration when setting commitment quantities
  - Remember commitments are counted in units and priced based on the tier pricing
</Tip>
