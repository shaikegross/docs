### How to create a new pricing plan

1.  Begin by selecting **Plans and Pricing** from the menu on the left hand side, then click **Create** in the upper right hand corner to create a new plan.
2.  **Name the plan** (e.g. "Premium plan") and add a description (optional).
3.  Click **Add Fees** to view the pricing elements menu.
4.  Choose to use fixed fees, usage charges, etc. as relevant. You'll be **able to add as many** of these to a single plan as you like; you just need to add them one by one.
5.  For each product, enter the product name and the amount to be charged.
6.  To add more items, select **Add Item** and fill in the required details. Each item you put in will be a line item on the invoice that is issued based on this pricing plan.
7.  Define the **plan setting details** - start date, duration, and billing interval.
    
Once you have finished this process, click **Save Plan and Continue** (at the bottom right of the page) to save your selections.
<Note>
 The system will then redirect you to the plan that it has created.
