  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setting Up Tiered Pricing
Tiered pricing allows you to create volume-based pricing structures where the price per unit changes based on usage levels.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Pricing Menu">
    Click on **Items & Pricing** and select **Tiered Pricing** from the available options
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Product">
    Click on **Select product source** to choose the product you want to create tiers for
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Basic Information">
    - Enter a descriptive **name** for your tiered pricing structure
    - Add a detailed **description** (optional but recommended for clarity)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Pricing Tiers">
    In the pricing tiers table:
    1. Set your first tier range:
       - The 'From' column starts at 0
       - Enter the upper limit in the 'To' column
    2. Add subsequent tiers:
       - Click **Add Row** for each new tier
       - The 'From' value automatically adjusts based on the previous tier's 'To' value
       - For the final tier, use -1 in the 'To' column to indicate unlimited
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Best Practices for Tiered Pricing:
- Ensure there are no gaps between tiers
- Make sure tier ranges don't overlap
- Consider volume discounts for higher tiers
- Keep tier structures simple and easy to understand
</Note>

## Working with Grouped Products (Bundles)
Grouped products allow you to create product bundles with shared pricing structures and commitments.

### Creating Product Groups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Base Product">
    Create a tiered pricing plan for your primary product as described above
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Group">
    1. Click the three-dot menu on the right side of the item
    2. Select **Grouped products**
    3. Provide a descriptive name for the group
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Product Variants">
    - Click **+ Add Product Variant** to add additional products to the group
    - Configure pricing for each variant individually
    - The group's commitment and base amount settings will apply to all variants
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Important Limitations for Grouped Products:
- All products in a group share the same billing cycle
