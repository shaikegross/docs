Once a contract template has been created, it can be assigned at any point to a new customer. 

-   Go to the **Plans & Pricing** page
-  Click on the three-dot menu on the line of the plan you wish to assign and select **Assign customer**
-   Define the starting date according to the customer's contractual terms and click 'Finish'.
    
It is also possible to assign a contract directly by selecting **Assign and save as a contract** from within the plan editor by using the **Save** dropdown menu.
