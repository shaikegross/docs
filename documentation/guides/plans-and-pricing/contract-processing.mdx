#### Contract Status
-   **Active / Inactive** - <br/>
    An active contract is a contract that is live and running. In the "Plans and Pricing" section, active contracts will be listed. These will either be in the "Customer contracts" page or  the "Plan templates" page. Here, you can filter by active, inactive, etc. Contracts with future live dates will show up as "inactive" and will become active upon contract start date.  Invoices of active contracts will show up in the "Invoices" and "Monthly Closure" sections.
    You can change a contract status from 'Active' to 'Inactive' -  this will suspend the billing automation and invoices wont be issued.
    
-   **Terminated** <br/>
     The contract will conclude on the specified end date. Upon termination, no additional invoices will be issued.
#### Revision
Revision allows you to edit the commercial terms of a contract within a billing cycle applicable for the following use cases:
1.  Renewal with new terms - renewal of contract with additional pricing terms. 
2.  Update of the current contract - update a contract with additional products, prices and discounts. Future invoices will be issued accordingly.  
#### Edit
Use this when you need to edit within the contract's terms before any invoices have been approved or issued. Changes will apply on "Draft" and invoices that are 'In approval' mode.
#### Delete
This will allow you to delete a contract and it's related invoices all together. This function is immediate and final - once deleted, a contract or invoice cannot be restored.
