#### Contract Status

* **Active / Inactive** - <br />
  An active contract is a contract that is live and running. In the **Plans and Pricing** section, active contracts will be listed. These will either be in the **Customer contracts** page or  the **Plan templates** page. <br /> Here, you can filter by active, inactive, etc. You can also deactivate a contract -  this will suspend the billing automation and invoices wont be issued. Contracts with future live dates will show up as 'Inactive' and will become active upon contract start date. <br /> Invoices of active contracts will show up in the **Invoices** and **Monthly Closure** sections. You can change a contract's status to Open, Paid, Pending, etc.

* **Terminated** <br />
  The contract will conclude on the specified end date. Upon termination, no additional invoices will be issued.
