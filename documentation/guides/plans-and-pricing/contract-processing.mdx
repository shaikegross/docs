#### Contract Status
-   **Active / Inactive** - <br/>
    An active contract is a contract that is live and running. In the **Plans and Pricing** section, active contracts will be listed. These will either be in the **Customer contracts** page or  the **Plan templates** page. <br/> Here, you can filter by active, inactive, etc. You can also deactivate a contract -  this will suspend the billing automation and invoices wont be issued. Contracts with future live dates will show up as 'Inactive' and will become active upon contract start date. <br/> Invoices of active contracts will show up in the **Invoices** and **Monthly Closure** sections. You can change a contract's status to Open, Paid, Pending, etc.
    
-   **Terminated** <br/>
     The contract will conclude on the specified end date. Upon termination, no additional invoices will be issued.
#### Revision
Revision allows you to edit the commercial terms of a contract within a billing cycle applicable for the following use cases:
-  **Renewal** with new terms - renewal of contract with additional pricing terms. 
-  **Update** of the current contract - update a contract with additional products, prices and discounts. Future invoices will be issued accordingly.  
#### Edit
Use this when you need to edit within the contract's terms before any invoices have been approved or issued. Changes will apply on **Draft** and invoices that are **'In approval'** mode.
#### Delete
This will allow you to delete a contract and it's related invoices all together. This function is immediate and final - once deleted, a contract or invoice cannot be restored.
