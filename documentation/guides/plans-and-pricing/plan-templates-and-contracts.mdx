#### Plan templates

Plan templates are used for payment plans commonly found on many websites, where you can choose between basic, premium, and enterprise versions. These plans might include fixed fees, usage-based fees, or a combination of both. You can customize the templates to your needs, and invoices will be issued accordingly.

-   Each plan you create can act as a template for an unlimited number of customers.
-   Plans can hold fixed fees and/or usage items.

#### Contracts
Contracts hold the commercial terms - products, services, prices & promotions, and the contractual terms of a customer.

Contracts are created automatically once a plan is assigned to a customer. You can also leverage data from your CRM or ERP platform to create one automatically.

-   It is possible to create a contract directly by using the "save and assign as a contract" from the save dropdown menu
-   Each customer can hold only one active contract.
