#### Plan templates

Plans are for the kinds of payment plans you find on many websites, such as when you can choose between basic, premium and enterprise versions of a plan. They might include fixed fees, usage-based fees, or a mixture of the two. You can customize it to your needs, and invoices will be issued accordingly.

-   Each plan you create can act as a template for an unlimited number of customers.
-   Plans can hold fixed fees and/or usage items.

#### Contracts
Contracts are what they sound like, they hold the commercial terms - products, services, prices & promotions, and the contractual terms of a customer.

  

Contracts are created automatically once a plan is assigned to a customer. You can also leverage data from your CRM or ERP platform to create one automatically.
