### Through the UI
You can view events in the Vayu UI by navigating to the Events option under the Usage tab in the left-hand navigation bar. This will display a list of the latest 100 events that have been recorded in the system.

### Through the API
You can also view events through the API by making a **GET request** to the _/events_ endpoint. The endpoint provides more options for filtering and the results.
