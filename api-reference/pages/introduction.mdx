  title="Single Purpose and Focus"
>
One of the standout features of the Vayu API is its focus on a single purpose. <br/>
The main usage of the API should be for logging in and sending events. <br/>
Other actions, such as creating customers and entering data metering details, should be carried out using the UI. 
This clear separation of concerns reduces the cognitive load for both developers and finance professionals.

## SDKs Availability
In addition to the API, Vayu also provides SDKs for various programming languages. These SDKs abstract away some of the complexities of working with the API directly and provide a more convenient and idiomatic way to interact with the Vayu system. The details of these SDKs will be covered in the following sections.
